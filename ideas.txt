Ideas:
- Have special flags
	- One which tells it to run a command in terminal on the file after it's created
		- Allow adding to the list with successive declarations
	- One which says "this next area is in reverse endian".. but actually doing that will be troublesome
		- Temp file?
	- Default min byte count (0), so you can have everything take up at least this amount of bytes
		- Can be redefined
		- Can be set to 'default' for, well, default
